# zumo-robot
School project involving a Zumo robot (https://www.pololu.com/category/129/zumo-robots-and-accessories) similar to the one shown on the website. The source file contains various tasks that the robot was required to complete, implemented in C.

Only the Main.c file is included because it was the only one modified and due to the project's nature we had to keep things simple and also to emphasize the code we actually wrote vs what was delivered to us. The whole project contained FreeRTOS and other low-level components.
